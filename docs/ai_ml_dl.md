# AI vs ML vs DL

AI refers to the broader concept of creating machines or systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. An algorithm refers to a specific set of rules, mathematical equations, or procedures that the machine learning model follows to learn from data and make predictions on.

DL is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers, deep neural networks, to learn and make sense of complex patterns in data.

There are several types of machine learning:
- Supervised Machine Learning *(extracting rules from data)*
    - the algorithm learns from labeled data making predictions or classification
- Unsupervised Machine learning *(extracting trends from data)*
    - the algorithm discovers patterns and structures in unlabeled data such as clustering or dimensionality reduction
- Reinforcement Learning *(solving tasks by trial and error)*
    - the agents learn to make predictions and decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or punishments
