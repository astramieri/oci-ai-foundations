# Jupiter Notebooks

**Anaconda** is an open source distribution of Python and R for Data Science and Machine Learning. It's designed to simplify package management and deployment. It is a toolbox that comes preloaded with all the essential tools and libraries needed for data science and machine learning.

Why to use Anaconda ?

- **Package Management**: easy to install and manage data science libraries and packages
- **Isolated Environments**: you can work on multiple projects with different package versions without any conflicts
- **Anaconda Navigator**: a very user-friendly interface to manage your environments, install packages, and launch Jupyter Notebooks all without needing to use the command line
- **Cross Platform Tool**: it is available for all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

**Jupyter Notebook** is a powerful, interactive development environment, which we usually call IDE that allows you to create and share documents containing live code equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is a very fantastic tool for prototyping data exploration and creating interactive presentations.
