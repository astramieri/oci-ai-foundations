- **AI should be lawful**, complying with all applicable laws and regulations
- **AI should be ethical**, that is it should ensure adherence to ethical principles and values that we uphold as humans
- **AI should be robust**, both from a technical and social perspective because even with the good intentions, AI systems can cause unintentional harm
