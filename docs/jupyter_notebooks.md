# Jupyter Notebooks

**Jupyter Notebook** is a powerful, interactive development environment, which we usually call IDE that allows you to create and share documents containing live code equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is a very fantastic tool for prototyping data exploration and creating interactive presentations.

## Anaconda

**Anaconda** is an open source distribution of Python and R for Data Science and Machine Learning. It's designed to simplify package management and deployment. It is a toolbox that comes preloaded with all the essential tools and libraries needed for data science and machine learning.

Why to use Anaconda ?

- **Package Management**: easy to install and manage data science libraries and packages
- **Isolated Environments**: you can work on multiple projects with different package versions without any conflicts
- **Anaconda Navigator**: a very user-friendly interface to manage your environments, install packages, and launch Jupyter Notebooks all without needing to use the command line
- **Cross Platform Tool**: it is available for all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

## Machine Learning Process

A typical machine learning process involves:
1. loading data
2. pre-processing
3. training a model
4. evaluating the model
5. making predictions

## Pythons Libraries

**Pandas Library** is used for data manipulation and provides data structures like dataframes and series for handling data efficiently.

**Scikit Learn** (sklearn) is a popular machine learning library that provides tool for data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation. 

**NumPy** library is used for numerical computations and provides arrays and mathematical functions.

## How to install libraries with Anaconda

    conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
    conda install -c anaconda numpy
