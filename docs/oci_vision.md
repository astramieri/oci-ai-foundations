# OCI Vision

OCI Vision provides two main capabilities:

1. Image Analysis 
2. Document AI

## Image Analysis

Image analysis analyzes photographic images. 

**Object Detection** is the feature that detects objects inside an image using a bounding box and assigning a label to each object with an accuracy percentage. Object detection also locates and extracts text that appears in the scene, like on a sign.

**Image classification** will assign classification labels to the image by identifying the major features in the scene. One of the most powerful capabilities of image analysis is that, in addition to pretrained models, users can retrain the models with their own unique data to fit their specific needs. 

## Document AI

Document AI is used for working with document images.

The features of document AI are:

- **Text Recognition**, also known Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

    This extracts text from images, including non-trivial scenarios, like handwritten texts, plus tilted, shaded, or rotated documents.

- **Document Classification** 

    It classifies documents into 10 different types based on visual appearance, high level features, and extracted keywords. This is useful when you need to process a document, based on its classification, like an invoice, a receipt, or a resume.

- **Language Detection** 

    It analyzes the visual features of text to determine the language rather than relying on the text itself. 
    
- **Table Extraction** 

    It identifies tables in docs and extracts their content in tabular form. 
    
- **Key value extraction**

    It finds values for 13 common fields and line items in receipts, things like merchant name and transaction date. 

OCI Document Understanding is a service in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure designed for automating document processing tasks, such as extracting information from documents, automating data entry, and streamlining document-based workflows. It's used for tasks such as invoice processing, form recognition, and document classification.
