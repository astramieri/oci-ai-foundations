# Task And Data

Three AI Domains:
- Language
- Audio and Speech
- Vision

## Language AI Tasks

Language-related AI tasks:
- Text-Related (use text as input and the output depends on the task)
    - Detect language
    - Extract entities or key phrases
    - Understand sentiment
    - Classify text based on content
    - Translate text
- Generative AI (the output text is generated by a model)
    - Create story, poem, etc.
    - Summarize text 
    - Answer questions
    - Generate image captions
    - Complete text
    - Convert text to speech

Text as Data:
- inherently sequential
    - sentences
- multiple words
    - tokenization
- varying sentence lengths
    - padding
- similar words
    - dot or cosine similarity and embedding

AI Language Models refer to artificial intelligence models that are specifically designed to understand process and generate natural language. These models have been trained on vast amounts of textual data that can perform various natural language processing or NLP tasks.

The deep learning model architectures that are typically used to train models that perform language tasks are:
- Recurrent Neural Networks
    - process data sequentially 
    - store hidden states
- Long Short-Term Memory
    - process data sequantially
    - can retain the context better through use of gates
- Transformers
    - process data in parallel
    - use concepts of self attention to better understand the context
